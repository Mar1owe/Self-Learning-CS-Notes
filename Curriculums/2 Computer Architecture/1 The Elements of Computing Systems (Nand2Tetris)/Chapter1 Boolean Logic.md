Every general-purpose computer--every PC, smartphones, or server--is a Nand to Tetris machine

A Computer System is built by breaking the system into "modules"  
module design: an acquired art

We will test the correctness of the HDL programs by using a software-based hardware simulator, just like how hardware engineers work.

# Boolean Algebra
Two state binary values: true/false, yes/no, on/off, etc. We will use 1 and 0.

{And, Or, Not} can express any Boolean function, and any of these three and be expressed using **Nand** (proof in appendix 1)
> Nand(x,y) is equivalent to Not(And(x,y))

We can define boolean functions using a *truth table* or *Boolean expressions*

**Truth Tables and Boolean Expressions**

Truth table: convenient means for describing states of nature  
Boolean expression: convenient formalism for realizing the description in silicon

The ability of simplifing Boolean expressions is important.
