Every general-purpose computer--every PC, smartphones, or server--is a Nand to Tetris machine

ALU : Arithmetic Logic Unit
RAM : Random Access Memory

*Church-Turing conjecture*

computer platform used: Hack
high-level language implemented: Jack

A Computer System is built by breaking the system into "modules"  
module design: an acquired art

"Hardware Discription Language" in appendix 2 (can be learnt in about 1 hour)
We will test the correctness of the HDL programs by using a software-based hardware simulator, just like how hardware engineers work.

# Booleaen Logic
## Boolean Algebra
Two state binary values: true/false, yes/no, on/off, etc. We will use 1 and 0.

Boolean function / Boolean operators: And, Or, Not  
Any of the three and be expressed using Nand
> Nand(x,y) is equivalent to Not(And(x,y))

We can define the function using a *truth table*
