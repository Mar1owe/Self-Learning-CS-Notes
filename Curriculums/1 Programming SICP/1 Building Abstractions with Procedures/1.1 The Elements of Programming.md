Dialect of Lisp used: `Scheme`

Abstraction

Three mechanisms of every powerful programming language  
1. primitive expressions (data, procedures)
2. combination  
3. abstraction  

In programming, we deal with ***procedures*** and ***data***.
## Expressions
primitive procedure -> compound expression (combination)  
operator, operand  (procedure, argument)  
prefix notation  
pretty-printing
## Naming and the Environment
`define`
```Lisp
(define <name> <value>)
```
(global) environment, name-object pairs
## Evaluating Combinations
Evaluation rule (**recursive**)
1. Evaluate the subexpressions
2. Apply the operator to the operands

tree accumulation  
special forms
## Compound Procedures
procedure definitions
```Lisp
(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)
```
## The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
1. applicative-order evaluation (is what Lisp uses)
2. normal-order evaluation (fully expand then reduce)
## Conditional Expressions and Predicates
```Lisp
(cond (⟨p₁⟩ ⟨e₁⟩)
      (⟨p₂⟩ ⟨e₂⟩)
      …
      (⟨pₙ⟩ ⟨eₙ⟩))
```
clause, predicate, consequent expression  

**Logical composition operations**
```Lisp
(if ⟨predicate⟩ ⟨consequent⟩ ⟨alternative⟩)

(and ⟨e₁⟩ … ⟨eₙ⟩)

(or ⟨e₁⟩ … ⟨eₙ⟩)

(not ⟨e⟩)
```
## Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method
Mathematics - Declarative Knowledge(What is ...)  
Computer Science - Imperative Knowledge(How to ...)

Newton's method (of computing square roots) - Successive approximaiton  
Start the guess with number 1, then improve the answer until it's close enough.  
## Procedures as Black-Box Abstractions
Break big programs into small pieces and deal with only one each time.  

**Local names**

The implementer's choice of names for the parameters doesn't matter during the procedure's implementation.  
The following are indistinguishable:
```Lisp
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (square y) (* y y))
```
*bound variable* (the name of the parameter doesn't matter, also we have free variable)  
*scope*

**Internal definitions and block structure**

localize subprocedures  
*block structure*, *lexical scoping*
