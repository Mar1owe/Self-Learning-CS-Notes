Dialect of Lisp used: `Scheme`
[Scheme Interpreter](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa14/assets/interpreter/scheme.html)

Three mechanisms of every powerful programming language  
1. primitive expressions  
2. means of combination  
3. means of abstraction  

In programming, we deal with ***procedures*** and ***data***.
## Expressions
combination  
operator, operand  
prefix notation  
pretty-printing
## Naming and the Environment
name, variable, object
`define`
## Evaluating Combinations
1. Evaluate the subexpression
2. Apply the operator to the operands(arguments)

"tree accumulation"  
special forms (such as `define`)
## Compound Procedures
percedure definitions
```Lisp
(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)
```
## The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
1. applicative-order evaluation
2. normal-order evaluation
## Conditional Expressions and Predicates
`cond`
```Lisp
(cond (⟨p₁⟩ ⟨e₁⟩)
      (⟨p₂⟩ ⟨e₂⟩)
      …
      (⟨pₙ⟩ ⟨eₙ⟩))
```
clause, predicate, consequent expression  

**Logical composition operations**
```Lisp
(if ⟨predicate⟩ ⟨consequent⟩ ⟨alternative⟩)

(and ⟨e₁⟩ … ⟨eₙ⟩)

(or ⟨e₁⟩ … ⟨eₙ⟩)

(not ⟨e⟩)
```
**Exercise 1.5 comparison between applicative-order and normal order, add this to "small projects"**
