The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer.

procedure: a pattern for the *local evolution* of a computational process.  
This section talks about some common "shapes" for procedures generated by simple procedures.
## Linear Recursion and Iteration
Example question: about factorial function $n!$  
1. *recursive process*
	characterized by a chain of deferred operations
	*linear recursive process* (the amount of information needed grows linearly with $$n$$)  
2. *iterative process*
	a fixed number of state variables + a fixed rule of updating the state variables

Difference between a recursive *process* and a recursive *procedure*
