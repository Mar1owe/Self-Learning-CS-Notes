procedure: a pattern for the *local evolution* of a computational process.
## Linear Recursion and Iteration
Example question: about factorial function $n!$  
1. *recursive process*  
	a chain of deferred operations  
	***linear recursive process***
2. *iterative process*  
	a fixed number of state variables + a fixed rule of updating the state variables  
	***linear iterative process***

Difference between a **recursive *process*** and a **recursive *procedure***

`Scheme` - *tail recursive*
## Tree Recursion
Example: Fibonacci numbers

```Lisp
(define (fib n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 0)
        ((= n 1) 1)
		(else (+ (fib (- n 1))
		         (fib (- n 2))))))
```
`Fib(n)` goes expotentially with n. `Fib(n)` is the closest integer to $\phi^n$

The Golden ratio $$\phi^2=\phi+1$$  $$\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx1.6180$$
```Lisp
(define (fib n)
  (fib-iter 1 0 n))

(define (fib-iter a b count)
  (if (= count 0)
      b
	  (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
```

**Example: Counting change**  
How many different ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies? More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money?
