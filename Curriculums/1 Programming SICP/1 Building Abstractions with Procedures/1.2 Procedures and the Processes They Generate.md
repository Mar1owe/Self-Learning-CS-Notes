procedure: a pattern for the *local evolution* of a computational process.

This section talks about some common "shapes" for procedures generated by simple procedures.
## Linear Recursion and Iteration
Example question: about factorial function $n!$  
1. *recursive process*  
	a chain of deferred operations  
	***linear recursive process***
2. *iterative process*  
	a fixed number of state variables + a fixed rule of updating the state variables  
	***linear iterative process***

Difference between a recursive *process* and a recursive *procedure*

`Scheme` - *tail recursive*

## Tree Recursion
Example: Fibonacci numbers

Golden ratio $\phi^2=\phi+1$, $\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx1.6180$
