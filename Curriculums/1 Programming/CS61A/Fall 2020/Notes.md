This is not just for self-learning but also acts as an internet archive.

When I tried to find all kinds of resources about the prestigious SICP, I found the *CS61A 2010 Fall* version. But the video quality is unacceptable, I could barely recognize anything written on the blackboard and code typed on Harvey's computer. I had to give up.

Later I found the CS61A official website. Well, although it is comprehensive. Some links in the previous version of CS61A (for example, fall 2020) have expired. So I decided to download everything (except the videos, of course) and keep it here. Hope this will help people who want to self-learn this great course in the future.

I understand that UCB no longer use the original SICP for CS61A, I'll read that book whenever I feel free or necessary.

Good luck, have fun!
