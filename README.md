> If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is. --John von Neuman
## Operating Systems
[**Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)  
Lion's Commentary on Unix  
The Design and Implemntation of the FreeBSD Operating System  
Max OS X Internals  
Linux Kernel Development  
Extra: A great way to consolidate your understanding of operating systems is to read the code of a small kernel and add features. One choice is [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html), a port of Unix V6 to ANSI C and x86, maintained for a course at MIT. OSTEP has an appendix of potential [xv6 labs](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-projects-xv6.pdf) full of great ideas for potential projects.

## Languages and Compilers
[**Crafting Interpreters** by Bob Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)  
> Don’t be a boilerplate programmer. Instead, build tools for users and other programmers. Take historical note of textile and steel industries: do you want to build machines and tools, or do you want to operate those machines? --Ras Bodik at the start of his compilers course
