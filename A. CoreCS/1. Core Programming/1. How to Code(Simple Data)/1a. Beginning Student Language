# Functions
| Functions are the most important part in a programming language  

To evaluate primitive call
- first  reduce operands to values(called the arguments) 
- then apply primitive to the values
For function definitions
- simply record definition

To evaluate function call
- first reduce operands to values (called the arguments)
- replace function call by
     - body of function in which every occurence of parameter(s) are replaced by corresponding argument

# Booleans and if Expressions
To evaluate an if expression
- if the question expression is not a value, evaluate it, and replace with value
- if the question is **true**, replace entire if expression with **true** answer expression
- if the question is **false**, replace entire if expression with **false** answer expression
- the question is a value other than true or false, so produce an **error**

# Primitives
Just guess and search the documentation, usually you'll find the right answer.
