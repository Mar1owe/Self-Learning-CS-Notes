**A Word Before the Chaper**  
*Lisp*ï¼Œthe second oldest language (the oldest is *Fortran*), is the programming language which we are going to use in this course. The dialect of Lisp used in this book is *Scheme*. 
[Scheme Interpreter](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa14/assets/interpreter/scheme.html)

Lisp has not overcome its old reputation as hopelessly inefficient, but it  is now used in many applications where efficiency is not the central concern. For example, operating-system shell languages and extension languages for editors and computer-aided design systems. 
# The Elements of Programming
Every powerful languages has three mechanisms for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas:
1. primitive expressions  
    which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
2. means of combination  
    by which comound elements are built from simpler ones, and
3. means of abstraction  
    by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

In programming, we deal with ***procedures*** and ***data***.
## Expressions
```
(+ 2 4)
6


(+ (* 3 (+ (* 2 4) (+ 3 5))) (+ (- 10 7) 6))
57


(+ (* 3
      (+ (* 2 4)
         (+ 3 5)))
   (+ (- 10 7)
      6))
57
```
combination: formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure application  
operator: `+`  
operand(s): `2`, `4`  
*prefix* notation: the convention of placing the operator tot he left of the operands  
*pretty-printing*: in which each long combination is written so that the operands are aligned vertically and the structure get displayed clearly.
## Naming and the Environment
The name identifies a *variable* whose *value* is the object.  
In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with `Define`
```
(define size 2)
size
2

(* 5 size)
10

(define pi 3.14159)
(define radius 10)
(* pi (* radius radius))
314.159

(define circumference (* 2 pi radius))
circumference
62.8318
```
To associate values with symbols for later retrieving, the interpreter has some kind of memory called ***global environment***.
